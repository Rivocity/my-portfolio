                <h3>Skills and aspirations:</h3>
                <p>I am currently working on HTML, which is what is used to create this website. I will progress into CSS, JS, and then hopefully Python, React, C, and Lua.</p>
                <p>I hope to learn these languages because python is just an overall good language from all I've heard and could prove useful.
                    React for UI Design as I am also interested in that and love creating beautiful designs that just look amazing. C to help me build a strong 
                    foundation for if I go into C++ in the future, and Lua because it's lightweight and often used in game development and one of my favorite games roblox, which interests me as well.
